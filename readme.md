# The power problem

The power problem consist in, given an electoral results, where there are agents with certain power W = {w<sub>1</sub>,...,w<sub>n</sub>} and an objective p, we want to know how many sums of subsets S of W can reach p in different configurations.

## The powerV1 problem

This version doesn't have any restrictions.

## The powerV2 problem

In this version, some agents can't be in the same subset as others, we will represent this as a list of impossible-to-ally agents for each agent
